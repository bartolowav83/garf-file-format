# Introducing...

# Garfield Image File Format (.GARF)
Thats project is stupid i know but for me, its an achievement !

For more informations about the project, im making a github repo soon.


# Advantage
- Its like a PNG file 
- Its compatible with old machines
- Can have transparency like PNG's

# Disadvantages
- This file format is large. (Fixing that issue soon)
- Impossible to read this file in every image visualizer.

You can convert :

- PNG → GARF
- GARF → PNG

  Coded with love in Python ❤
