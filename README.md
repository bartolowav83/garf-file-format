# Introducing...

# Garfield Image File Format (.GARF)
Thats project is stupid i know but for me, its an achievement !

For more informations about the project, im making a github repo soon.


# Advantage
- Its like a PNG file 
- Its compatible with old machines
- Can have transparency like PNG's

# Disadvantages
- This file format is large. (Fixing that issue soon)
- Impossible to read this file in every image visualizer.
- When you convert a GARF into a PNG file, the transparency is gone

Before you convert, you need the following library :
- Pillow

You can convert :

- PNG → GARF
- GARF → PNG

NOTICE : IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN CHANGE THE INPUT AND THE OUTPUT FILENAME IN THE CONVERTER.

  Coded with love in Python ❤
